# EDA Global Superstore

## Background
Global superstore is a unreal store that doing sales business for various customers both the company and personal customer. They also sells various stuffs range from office supplies, furniture, and technology. They have a lot of sales data and they want to use the sales data to understand their current sales better to improve and maximize their sales performance. As a data analyst in the global superstore company I am assigned to analyze and get insight about their current sales data by using exploratory data analysis.
In EDA I will try to understand the data, such as the variables, its data types, null value, and  performing descriptive statistics. EDA is important because it helps us to decide what the next things we need to do before performing data analysis or creating a new model. Using sample superstore dataset I will do the EDA to know which region is having the highest profit, highest sales, which product or category is more proftitable and many more.

## Business Understanding
In this section I will breakdown problem, goal, objective, and the business matrix.

### 1. Problem
How to help global superstore understand its current sales data to maximize its sales and profit in the future 

### 2. Goal
Understanding and representing the current sales data in Global Superstore

### 3. Objective
Do teh exploratory data analysis to understand and get insight from the current dataset 

### 4. Initial Insight
To understand its sales performance, company needs to do exploratory data analysis to find pattern, correlation, and the meaning of their data. 

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis 
In this part I will explain the result of the exploratory data analysis that has been done. For full code can be accessed here :

### 5.1. Dataset Description
The data set contains 9993 rows and 113 columns. And there is no null values for all variables or columns.

In the dataset description, for postal code columns, its data type is still int, so that i change the datatype into object to make the dataset valid. 
Below are the details of each columns after I change the data type for postal code column. Since there is no null value in the dataset, I will proceed the dataset for further analysis.

### 5.2. Analysis of Categorical Variable 
From the data set, I did analysis separately for categorical and continous variable. In this section I will explain my finding on categorical variables. 
From the categorical variables I can find details of each variable as decribed in the column below:
